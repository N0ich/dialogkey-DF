Adds the ability to bind a button (default: spacebar) that can accept popup dialogs, select quests at quest givers, complete quests, etc. when pressed.

# Dragonflight Rewrite
DialogKey's original author stopped maintaining the addon at some point during BfA. Shadowlands greatly modified the Gossip and Quest panes, breaking much of the functionality, and Dragonflight has done so again with its UI remake.

This version of DialogKey is a not-quite-entirely-rewritten version, using the newest Gossip + Quest APIs!

# Known Issues / Missing Features
- Popup Dialogs (e.g. delete confirmations, resurrections, release spirit, etc.) do not currently get clicked by the addon.
- Gossip choices are occasionally selected incorrectly. (E.g. pressing '2' selects option marked '3', etc.)
- No in-game configuration options are currently available.
- Post-click cooldown/lockout option is currently unimplemented.
